## Analyzing and Predicting Airbnb Listing Price and Host Type in New York City


### Project Objectives

* Analyzing neighborhood popularity for superhosts and non-superhosts, based on traffic, types of rooms (private rooms/shared rooms/entire apartment), and price
* Drawing a comparison between the pre- and post-COVID listing prices
* Predicting the type of host (superhosts/non-superhosts) and understanding what attributes contribute to the classification of a superhost
* Predicting the price for Airbnb listings in New York City and understanding what features contribute to profitable business opportunities for Airbnb

### Data Source
Our datasets were taken from [InsideAirbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and were last updated in October 2020.
